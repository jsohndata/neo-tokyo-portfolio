> This panorama is too big for your device! It's 5660px wide, but your device only supports images up to 4096px wide. Try another device. (If you're the author, try scaling down the image.)

The fix I used is to bring down the image to 4,090px. I used Webp instead and brought a file from 2.5MB to about 600k
