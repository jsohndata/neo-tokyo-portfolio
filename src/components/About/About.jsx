          <p>My upbringing has had a significant impact on my worldview. I was born in Korea and later moved to Hawaii for high school, where I experienced a challenging transition from East to West society. After that, I pursued a ceramics degree at an art school in Rhode Island and started my career as a web developer in Boston in 2001 before moving to Baltimore, Maryland. Life has been unpredictable, but I have come to embrace the unexpected.</p>
          <p>In 2023, I had the privilege of being a senior instructor at Boca Code, where I worked with the next generation of software engineers. I took a contrarian approach to teaching, encouraging my students to think critically both as individuals and as part of a team. I am grateful that I learned so much from them, as "noCAP" had a whole different meaning.</p>        
          <p>Looking to the future, I am fascinated by the potential of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML). As a contrarian, I am eager to explore these fields from a unique perspective and contribute to their growth in ways that challenge conventional thinking. The possibilities are endless, and who knows what unexpected discoveries we might make â€“ perhaps even having PB&J sandwiches on the moon!</p>
