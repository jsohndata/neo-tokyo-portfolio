        <p>My upbringing has had a significant impact on my worldview. I was born in Korea and later moved to Hawaii for high school, where I experienced a challenging transition from East to West society. After that, I pursued a ceramics degree at an art school in Rhode Island and started my career as a web developer in Boston in 2001 before moving to Baltimore, Maryland. Life has been unpredictable, but I have come to embrace the unexpected.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am a senior instructor at Boca Code, where I have the privilege of working with the next generation of software engineers. I take a contrarian approach to teaching, encouraging my students to think critically as individuals and as part of a team. Their unique perspectives inspire me to learn from them and continue to grow.</p>
        
        <p>Looking to the future, I am fascinated by the potential of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML). As a contrarian, I am eager to explore these fields from a unique perspective and contribute to their growth in ways that challenge conventional thinking. The possibilities are endless, and who knows what unexpected discoveries we might make â€“ perhaps even having PB&J sandwiches on the moon!</p>
